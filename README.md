## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

Simply fork the reposity and run 

```
npm install 
```

and then 

``` 
npm run 
```


## What I learned

Redux is power! After the previous project, I can imagine the headaches involved with passing application state through props and back again. With redux, it state management is centralized, predictable, and a whole lot easier.

Dynamic router (for different individual poll pages). 


## What could be improved

Account creation, and real user authentication with sticky sessions.
